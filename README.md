# Generate Markdown Challenge

**Version 1.0.0**

## The Purpose
The purpose of this project was to generate a MarkDown strictly from the commandline using node.js to allow one to seamlessly create MarkDowns for future projects by automating the process.

## Significant Changes
This project required us to utilize node.js for the first time. This was different from our usual interactions with concepts that involve the browser, html, and styling etc. Also we have become more accustomed to npm packages such as inquirer which allow us to create the questions.

### Challenges
Challenges included getting familiar with the documentation, and figuring out how to transpose question data into a full fledged ReadMe. Once that was understood it was more nuance like if the question contained the optionality to not include it in the ReadMe how would one go about making sure it doesn't get included in the return script for example.
